# BioTRY: A comprehensive knowledge base for titer, rate, and yield of biosynthesis

Synthetic biology is rapidly evolving into a data-intensive science that increasingly relies on massive datasets; one of its applica-tions is the evaluation of the economic viability of fermentation processes. However, the key economic indicators, namely titer, rate, and yield (TRY), which respectively reflect the downstream processing, reactor size, and raw material costs, are not well cap-tured in bioinformatics databases. In this paper, we present BioTRY, an intuitive and user-friendly tool that contains >5,000 bio-chemicals and >3,800 strains, along with over 52,000 corresponding TRY entries with original references. It is freely available at http://www.synbiohealth.cn/biotry. To our knowledge, BioTRY is the first available database on biosynthesis TRY data from orig-inal research. We anticipate that BioTRY will become a useful tool that aids researchers and decision-makers in understanding the current development state of biosynthesis and allows them to foresee potential prospects and applications for biosynthesis.
